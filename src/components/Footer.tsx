          This GitHub repository, authored by Killdroid2342, is intended as a
          non-functional practice project, distinct from the actual StockX
          platform, and should not be mistaken for the genuine service. Serving
          as a learning exercise, this dummy project potentially allows
          Killdroid2342 to develop skills in web development, UI/UX design, and
          collaboration using Git and GitHub workflows. By clearly stating its
          purpose as a learning tool, this repository might offer a space for
          experimentation, skill showcase, and collaboration, while also serving
          as a portfolio piece to demonstrate growth and proficiency over time.
          It provides a valuable resource for learning and development,
          featuring a disclaimer to emphasize its non-official status compared
          to StockX.
